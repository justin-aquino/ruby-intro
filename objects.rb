# Intro to Ruby Objects

#String Objects

puts "Hello World".length

puts "hello world".upcase #same as JS toUpperCase method

puts "HELLO WORLD".downcase # same as JS toLowerCase method.


greeting = "hello Justin"


puts greeting.upcase


#Methods are behaviors or functionalities that an object is capable of doing.

puts greeting.upcase() #can work with or without parentheses. But convention is, if you don't need it, don't use it.

#INTEGER OBJECTS

puts 10.next #outputs the number after 10.

puts -1.next #also works on negative numbers.

puts 10.succ #short for successor. Works the same as .next.

puts 10.pred #will give you the number before. (9) Short for predecessor.
