#Variables

age = 31

puts age

puts last_name = "Jiji"

puts name + last_name

puts "Hello my name is #{last_name} #{name}. I am #{age} years old."

#variables can store values of different data types, unlike other programming languages that require a variable to have a value with consistent data type.

x = 1
y = 2

puts "the sum of #{x} and #{y} is #{x + y} " #nice. You  can pretty much do anything in the interpolation
